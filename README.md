## Introduction

Automatons.ipynb is a comprehensive educational and experimental tool that helps understand and practice the concepts and operations of finite automata. The notebook is interactive, allowing users to directly run the code, modify examples, and see results in real-time.

## Installation

To install the dependencies required to run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install uv if it's not already installed:
   ```
   pip install uv
   ```

2. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/wolgyes/formal_languages_dfa_nfa
   ```

3. Enter the project directory:
   ```
   cd formal_languages_dfa_nfa
   ```

4. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

## Usage

To start the notebook, activate the virtual environment and then run the following command:

```
jupyter notebook Automatons.ipynb
```
